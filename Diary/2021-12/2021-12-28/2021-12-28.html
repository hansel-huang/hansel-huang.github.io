            <div class="paper-sheet">
                <p>I create the Highlight Record Area to record things that make me feel honourable. I will put something important that I tried my best in that moment or made lots of efforts to complete it. That would be very valuable for me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This afternoon, we had oral exam of Professional English to report our questionnaires. I think Manar didn't focused on my talking. When it was my turn, he even realized my topic is Metaverse long time later. The question he asked is information security. When I state my questionnaire is Metaverse, that he realized and said "ahh, Metaverse". I know he didn't focused my talking well. But I had doing wrong also, I just read my sentences that I prepared before. It's truly hard to get information effectively if you just read something but with no thinking.</p>
                <p>Oral English is not easy for us right now, ha. The most important is input a lot and ouput as much as possible.</p>
